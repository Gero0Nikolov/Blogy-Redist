			<h1>Congratulations <?php echo $profileFirst ?> :-)</h1>
			<p>
				You've just created a new <b>Blogy club</b> !<br>
				In the clubs you can share everything that you like with your truly followers.
				Your club is not an ordinary story, in it you can talk with your friends and followers into the comments of your posts.
				Also if you want you can allow the members of your club to share their personal moments too :-)
			</p>

			<h1>Configure your Club</h1>
			<p>
				By default you are an admin of your club from the minute you've created it.
				So when you preview your club, you'll see it from the <b>Admin</b> side, 
				this doesn't mean you can't change the sides and look you club just like a visitor with one simple click.
				Also by default your club <b>don't have</b> an unique logo, which means that you 
				won't be able to make it public until you don't upload its <i>#unique</i> logo.
				In <b>Blogy</b> we've designed the things to be easy as possible and everything to be on one click distance.
				That's why we can't tell you more about the clubs it is that easy.. 
				Have fun with your new <b>Blogy club</b> :-)
